## **Unnecessary Prime Number Calculations in the Background**  

Looking at our terminal logs, we notice something strange: **the prime number calculation keeps running every time we click the increment button.**  

At first glance, this seems logical—**after all, the `isPrime` function is inside `Counter`, and `Counter` re-renders whenever the counter state updates.** But let’s break this down and see why it’s actually a problem.  

---

### **🔍 What’s Happening?**  

Inside `Counter.jsx`, we have this line:  

```jsx
const initialCountIsPrime = isPrime(initialCount);
```
- `initialCountIsPrime` determines whether the **initial count** (not the updated counter value) is a prime number.  
- But **`initialCount` only changes when we input a new number and press ‘Set’**—**NOT** when we increment or decrement.  

Yet, **our logs show `isPrime` running every time we increment the counter.** Why? 🤔  

---

### **🤯 The Root Issue: Unnecessary Recalculations**  
Let’s analyze our `Counter` component:  

```jsx
export default function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  log("<Counter /> rendered", 1);
  
  const initialCountIsPrime = isPrime(initialCount); // 🔥 Unnecessary recalculations
  
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(initialCount);

  const handleDecrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter - 1);
  }, []);

  const handleIncrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
  }, []);
}
```

Whenever `Counter` re-renders (which happens every time `counter` changes):  
✅ The `isPrime(initialCount)` function **runs again**, even though `initialCount` hasn’t changed.  

That means:  
- If `isPrime` is a lightweight function, we may not notice an impact.  
- **But if `isPrime` is a complex, CPU-intensive calculation, this is a serious performance issue.**  

Imagine if we were running an expensive mathematical operation or fetching data every time we pressed "Increment"—**it would be an unnecessary performance drain!**

## **memo vs useMemo: What’s the Difference?**  

Both `memo` and `useMemo` are used to **optimize performance** by preventing unnecessary re-renders or re-executions. But they work in **different ways** and serve different purposes.  

---

### **🛠️ `memo`: Optimizing React Components**  
✅ `memo` is a **higher-order component** that wraps around **entire component functions** to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
✅ It **only re-renders the component if its props change**.  

### **Example: Using `memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders**  
```jsx
import { memo } from "react";

const ExpensiveComponent = memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ data }) {
  console.log("ExpensiveComponent rendered!");
  return <div>{data}</div>;
});
```
🔹 **Without `memo`,** this component would re-render every time its parent re-renders, even if `data` hasn’t changed.  
🔹 **With `memo`,** it only re-renders if `data` changes.  

---

### **🚀 `useMemo`: Optimizing Expensive Computations**  
✅ `useMemo` is used inside component functions to **memoize the result of expensive calculations.**  
✅ It **remembers the result of a function** and **only re-executes if its dependencies change.**  

### **Example: Using `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary calculations**  
```jsx
import { useMemo } from "react";

function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const initialCountIsPrime = useMemo(() => isPrime(initialCount), [initialCount]);

  return <div>Is Prime? {initialCountIsPrime ? "Yes" : "No"}</div>;
}
```
🔹 **Without `useMemo`,** `isPrime(initialCount)` would run on every re-render, even if `initialCount` hasn’t changed.  
🔹 **With `useMemo`,** it **only recalculates** when `initialCount` changes.

## **🧐 When Should You Use Them?**  

| Feature | `memo` | `useMemo` |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Used for | **Entire components** | **Expensive calculations** inside components |
| Prevents | **Unnecessary re-renders** | **Unnecessary re-executions** of functions |
| When to use | When a component **receives the same props frequently** but doesn't need to re-render | When a function **doesn't need to be recalculated** every time a component re-renders |
| How it works | **Compares old and new props** | **Caches and reuses previous results** |

---

### **🔑 Key Takeaways**  
✅ **Use `memo`** to **prevent unnecessary component re-renders** when props haven’t changed.  
✅ **Use `useMemo`** to **cache expensive function results** and only recompute them when necessary.  
✅ **Both should be used sparingly!** Overusing them can actually **hurt performance** instead of improving it.  


## **🚀 The Fix: `useMemo` to Cache Expensive Computations**  

To **prevent unnecessary recalculations**, we use `useMemo`.  
- `useMemo` **remembers** the result of a function and only recalculates it when its dependencies change.  

### **✅ Optimized Code with `useMemo`**  
```jsx
import { useMemo } from "react";

export default function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  log("<Counter /> rendered", 1);
  
  const initialCountIsPrime = useMemo(() => isPrime(initialCount), [initialCount]); // ✅ Now only runs when `initialCount` changes

  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(initialCount);

  const handleDecrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter - 1);
  }, []);

  const handleIncrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
  }, []);
}
```

---

### **🔥 Why Does This Work?**  
- **Before:** `isPrime(initialCount)` ran **on every re-render**, even if `initialCount` stayed the same.  
- **Now:** With `useMemo`, `isPrime(initialCount)` **only runs when `initialCount` changes**—not when we increment/decrement the counter.  

This prevents unnecessary computations and **significantly improves performance, especially for complex calculations.** 🚀  

---

## **🔑 Key Takeaways**  
✅ **Expensive computations should be memoized** with `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary executions.  
✅ `useMemo(() => expensiveFunction(value), [value])` **only recalculates when `value` changes.**  
✅ `useCallback` is for **memoizing functions**, while `useMemo` is for **memoizing values**.  
✅ **Think twice before placing heavy calculations inside a React component function!** If it depends on a prop or state that rarely changes, memoize it.  

Now, our counter is **optimized**, our prime number calculation runs **only when needed**, and we’ve **eliminated an unnecessary performance bottleneck.** 🎉
